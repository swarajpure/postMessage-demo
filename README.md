## Steps to run locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. You can directly open the `index.html` file in your prefered browser OR if you use VSCode, you can use an extension called `Live Server` to open the `index.html` file and it'll take care of hot-reloading for you (you won't have to reload manually every time you make changes ðŸ˜‰)
